Hostman
</h2>
A simple Android app that can preview/edit /etc/hosts file in a GUI manner.
Requires [Shizuku](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Shizuku/) in root mode.

Tested on OnePlus 8 and Xiaomi MIX2S, both are running Android 10.

Note: You may also need to mount the /system folder with r/w permission in your
favourite approach in advance.
